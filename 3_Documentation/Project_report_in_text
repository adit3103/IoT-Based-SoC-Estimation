Executive Summary
This project presents a solution for estimating the State of Charge (SoC) of a lithium-ion 
battery cell using three complementary methods: Direct Voltage Method, Coulomb 
Counting, and the Kalman Filter. The objective is to provide a real-time, accurate, and 
cost-effective embedded system that monitors the charge level of a battery and 
communicates data over IoT for energy management applications.
The Direct Voltage Method uses open circuit voltage to infer SoC, providing a simple 
estimation based on battery voltage under rest conditions. Coulomb Counting involves 
integrating the current over time using a current sensor to calculate charge in/out. Kalman 
Filtering provides a more robust estimation by combining model-based prediction and sensor 
data, correcting errors inherent in the other methods.
The entire system is built using Arduino, a voltage divider network, current sensors 
(ACS712), and IoT modules monitor SoC remotely. The project also addresses limitations 
like sensor drift and non-linearities in battery behaviour by integrating these three methods.
This smart SoC estimation system is applicable in renewable energy, electric vehicles, and 
IoT-enabled smart grids, promoting energy efficiency and sustainability. It is affordable, 
scalable, and adaptable to different battery chemistries, making it suitable for real-world 
deployment in both academic and industrial settings.

1. INTRODUCTION
The demand for accurate and reliable Battery control structures (BMS) has grown 
tremendously in latest years, mostly due to the widespread adoption of lithium-ion batteries 
in an expansion of programs. these programs consist of electric powered motors (EVs), 
renewable strength garage structures like sun microgrids, and transportable electronic devices 
including smartphones, laptops, and clinical device. As the worldwide transition toward 
inexperienced and sustainable technology accelerates, the performance and safety of battery￾powered systems have emerge as paramount. among the numerous parameters that a BMS 
monitors, the state of charge (SoC) sticks out as one of the maximum critical. SoC gives a 
quantitative estimate of the last electricity in a battery relative to its complete ability and 
performs a crucial position in determining the battery's usability and lifespan.
as it should be estimating the SoC of a battery is vital for numerous motives. firstly, it 
guarantees the safe operation of the battery-powered machine by preventing each 
overcharging and deep discharging. these excessive situations can result in excessive results 
including thermal runaway, potential loss, or maybe everlasting harm to the battery cells. 
Secondly, unique SoC information enables higher power control strategies, which allows in 
optimizing the usage of available power, mainly in energy-confined structures. ultimately, it 
contributes to prolonging the battery’s operational existence, thereby lowering the frequency 
of battery replacements and contributing to environmental sustainability by using minimizing 
digital waste.
conventional techniques of estimating SoC, which include easy voltage-primarily based 
dimension, have verified to be insufficient for contemporary packages. This inadequacy is 
usually due to the non-linear discharge behavior of lithium-ion batteries, that is closely 
influenced with the aid of outside elements consisting of load situations, temperature 
fluctuations, and the age of the battery. below various loads, the terminal voltage of a battery 
can deviate drastically, making it an unreliable standalone indicator of SoC.
2
To overcome these limitations, this project proposes a comprehensive, real-time, and IoT￾enabled approach for SoC estimation, leveraging the strengths of three complementary 
methods:
1. Direct Voltage Method: This technique estimates the SoC based on the battery’s 
open-circuit voltage (OCV). When the battery is at rest or under very light load 
conditions, the terminal voltage correlates well with the SoC, making this method 
simple yet effective. However, it is sensitive to temperature changes and becomes 
inaccurate under load due to voltage drops.
2. Coulomb Counting Method: In this method, the current flowing in and out of the 
battery is measured continuously using a current sensor, and the net charge/discharge 
is calculated over time through integration. While this method provides real-time data 
and is easy to implement, it suffers from long-term drift due to sensor inaccuracies and 
requires periodic calibration to maintain reliability.
3. Kalman Filter Method: This is a sophisticated, model-based estimation technique that 
combines real-time sensor data with predictive modeling. The Kalman filter 
continuously corrects SoC estimates by accounting for uncertainties in both 
measurements and battery behavior. It significantly improves accuracy, particularly in 
dynamic and non-linear operating environments, by minimizing the cumulative errors 
seen in simpler methods.
By integrating these three estimation techniques into an embedded platform based on 
Arduino or ESP32 microcontrollers, and coupling it with IoT modules for wireless 
communication, this project delivers a robust, scalable, and cost-effective solution. The SoC 
data is displayed locally on an LCD and transmitted remotely via cloud platforms like Blynk 
or ThingSpeak, enabling real-time monitoring through smartphones or web dashboards. This 
hybrid system addresses the drawbacks of individual methods and provides enhanced 
accuracy, reliability, and usability, making it highly suitable for applications ranging from 
electric vehicles to smart grids and portable energy systems.
Ultimately, this IoT-based SoC estimation system supports the goals of smart energy 
management, enhances battery safety, and contributes to the broader vision of sustainable and 
intelligent technological development.

1.1 LITERATURE REVIEW
Numerous studies efforts have been directed in the direction of developing strong and accurate 
nation of charge (SoC) estimation techniques for lithium-ion batteries, which can be 
extensively used in electric powered automobiles, renewable power structures, and 
transportable electronic devices. appropriately determining SoC is vital for making sure 
battery protection, efficiency, and durability. over time, researchers have proposed various 
techniques, every with its very own strengths and boundaries.
• Direct Voltage approach: this is one of the most simple and broadly followed strategies 
because of its simplicity and simplicity of implementation. It estimates the SoC by using 
mapping the terminal voltage of the battery to a pre-defined voltage-to-SoC curve, 
typically obtained below no-load or relaxation situations. at the same time as this approach 
is computationally inexpensive and can be applied with minimal hardware (consisting of 
a voltage divider and ADC), it is rather touchy to external elements such as battery 
temperature, internal resistance, cellular getting old, and ranging load conditions. 
underneath dynamic loads, the terminal voltage can also range drastically because of 
voltage drop, leading to faulty SoC readings. studies consisting of Piller et al. [1] spotlight 
that while the Direct Voltage method is beneficial in strong or idle situations, it's far nice 
employed in combination with more advanced techniques for progressed reliability.
• Coulomb Counting approach: This technique involves constantly measuring the present 
day flowing into and out of the battery and integrating it over the years to calculate the 
internet rate fed on or saved. The essential equation is primarily based on the connection 
among modern and charge, making this method well-suited for real-time programs. but, 
the Coulomb Counting method is vulnerable to cumulative waft over extended intervals 
because of inaccuracies in present day sensor calibration, noise, and offset mistakes. This 
drift can result in huge deviations in SoC estimation unless periodically corrected. 
research with the aid of Kim et al. [2] emphasizes the importance of enforcing periodic 
calibration routines or combining this method with voltage-primarily based correction to 
keep long-term accuracy and reliability.
4
• Kalman clear out approach: that is a version-based totally, predictive estimation method 
that makes use of recursive mathematical filtering to estimate the internal country of a 
machine—in this situation, the SoC of a battery. The Kalman filter fuses real-time sensor 
measurements (consisting of voltage and modern-day) with a mathematical model of 
battery behaviour, allowing it to dynamically expect and accurate SoC estimates. This 
technique efficaciously reduces the noise and blunders delivered via sensors and 
compensates for uncertainties inside the machine. in step with He et al. [3], Kalman 
filtering offers full-size enhancements in SoC accuracy, in particular below fluctuating 
masses and non-linear battery traits. even though computationally more worrying than the 
alternative methods, it's far an increasing number of viable for microcontroller-primarily 
based packages because of advancements in embedded processing abilties.
• IoT Integration: With the upward push of smart systems and the net of factors (IoT), 
there was growing hobby in integrating SoC estimation with cloud-primarily based 
platforms. IoT enables real-time far-flung monitoring, records logging, and user 
interaction through smartphones and web dashboards. research inclusive of Noh et al. [4] 
reveal that IoT integration complements the usability, accessibility, and intelligence of 
battery tracking systems, especially in dispensed or inaccessible environments.
From the overview of existing literature and techniques, it is glaring that no single approach 
can deliver pretty accurate and regular SoC estimation throughout all working conditions. 
every method has inherent boundaries that lessen its effectiveness in certain eventualities. 
therefore, researchers have an increasing number of proposed hybrid fashions that integrate 
more than one techniques to leverage the benefits of every at the same time as compensating 
for their weaknesses. The hybrid version proposed on this project—combining Direct 
Voltage, Coulomb Counting, and Kalman Filtering strategies—objectives to supply a greater 
accurate, sturdy, and real-time SoC estimation framework. The incorporation of IoT 
technology further complements the device by using allowing far off diagnostics, person￾pleasant interfaces, and integration with broader electricity control structures.

1.2 RESEARCH GAP
Despite the availability of several individual State of Charge (SoC) estimation techniques, 
significant challenges and limitations still remain. These gaps hinder the effectiveness, 
reliability, and practical deployment of SoC estimation systems, especially in real-world and 
resource-constrained environments. The key gaps identified are as follows:
1. Accuracy and Drift Compensation: Coulomb counting suffers from long-term drift, while 
voltage-based methods lack precision under load. A fusion of multiple techniques is needed 
for better accuracy.
2. Lack of Real-Time Integration: Many studies focus solely on algorithm development 
without integrating the estimation into real-time embedded platforms that can be deployed.
3. Limited IoT Deployment: Although IoT has been widely adopted in smart homes and 
industry, its application in real-time battery SoC monitoring remains underexplored, 
especially using hybrid methods.
4. Non-adaptiveness to Environmental Conditions: Many methods assume constant 
temperature or ignore dynamic conditions like fluctuating load, which affect SoC estimation 
significantly.
5. Scalability and Cost Constraints: Most accurate systems use expensive data acquisition 
systems or require proprietary battery management units, making them unsuitable for small￾scale applications or research prototypes.
This project addresses these limitations by developing a cost-effective hybrid SoC 
estimation system, implemented on a low-power microcontroller such as Arduino or 
ESP32. The solution integrates three estimation techniques—Direct Voltage, Coulomb 
Counting, and Kalman Filtering—into a unified system with IoT capabilities for remote data 
access. The resulting platform is not only accurate and real-time but also affordable and 
scalable, making it ideal for academic projects, research prototypes, and small-scale industrial 
applications.

1.3 PROBLEM STATEMENT
With the growing use of rechargeable batteries in electric vehicles, renewable energy systems, 
consumer electronics, and medical devices, ensuring their safe, efficient, and reliable operation 
is more important than ever. At the heart of battery management lies the State of Charge 
(SoC)—a critical metric that reflects the remaining usable energy in a battery. Accurate SoC 
estimation is vital to prevent overcharging or deep discharging, which can lead to battery 
degradation, thermal issues, or failure.
However, real-time SoC estimation remains challenging, especially under dynamic load 
conditions and prolonged use. Traditional methods have limitations: the voltage-based 
method is simple but inaccurate under load due to voltage drops and non-linear discharge 
curves, while the coulomb counting method, though real-time, suffers from long-term drift 
caused by sensor errors and requires regular calibration.
Additionally, many existing systems lack IoT capabilities, making them unsuitable for remote 
monitoring and data logging. Without real-time connectivity, users cannot receive timely alerts 
on low SoC or unusual activity, limiting system reliability and responsiveness.
To address these issues, there is a need for a cost-effective, accurate, and real-time SoC 
estimation system that:
• Combines multiple estimation techniques to enhance accuracy and robustness,
• Integrates with low-cost microcontrollers for practical deployment,
• And supports IoT-based remote monitoring and data access via mobile or cloud 
platforms.
This project aims to develop such a solution by implementing a hybrid SoC estimation system
using Direct Voltage, Coulomb Counting, and Kalman Filter methods. These will be 
deployed on an embedded microcontroller platform such as Arduino or ESP32 and 
enhanced with Wi-Fi/Bluetooth communication for real-time data transmission to a 
smartphone or cloud-based dashboard. The result is a scalable and intelligent system that not 
only improves SoC accuracy but also enhances usability in both research and industrial
environments.

8. RESULT ANALYSIS
To validate the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed hybrid State of Charge (SoC) 
estimation system, a series of controlled experiments were conducted using a single-cell 3.7V, 
2200mAh lithium-ion battery. The battery was subjected to well-defined charge and discharge 
cycles, using programmable electronic loads to simulate real-world power consumption and 
USB chargers to replenish charge. These tests aimed to evaluate the performance of each SoC 
estimation technique—voltage-based, Coulomb counting, and Kalman filter integration—
under varying load conditions, as well as assess the effectiveness of IoT-based monitoring.
The voltage-based method relied on a static mapping between open-circuit voltage and the 
battery’s SoC. A voltage–SoC curve was generated through extensive empirical 
measurements taken at various charge levels under no-load conditions. This method proved 
to be simple and quick, offering reliable estimations when the battery was idle or operating 
under negligible current draw. However, the approach suffered from significant inaccuracies 
during active charge and discharge phases. The primary cause of this degradation was voltage 
sag—a transient drop in terminal voltage under load—which led to underestimation of SoC 
and diminished the method’s reliability in dynamic, real-time scenarios.
In contrast, the Coulomb counting method provided real-time tracking of the battery’s 
charge and discharge activity. By integrating the current measurements from the INA219 
current sensor, the system continuously calculated the net charge flowing into or out of the 
battery. This approach yielded accurate and responsive SoC values over short durations and 
during rapid load changes. However, as expected, it was susceptible to cumulative errors and 
drift over time due to factors like sensor offset, noise, and integration inaccuracies. The long￾term reliability of this method was found to be limited unless periodic resets or calibration 
procedures were employed to realign the computed SoC with known reference points.
To address these limitations, the system incorporated a Kalman filter, which fused data from 
both the voltage-based and Coulomb counting methods. This advanced filtering technique 
used a predictive-corrective model to minimize errors by weighing both estimations based on 
their uncertainties. During experimentation, the Kalman filter significantly improved SoC 
estimation accuracy and stability, particularly under rapidly changing load conditions. It 
22
effectively suppressed drift and offset errors while providing smooth and consistent SoC 
readings. After tuning various filter parameters, a Kalman gain range between 0.4 and 0.6
was identified as the optimal balance between responsiveness and noise suppression, ensuring 
robust performance in diverse operating conditions.
Overall, the testing phase confirmed that the hybrid estimation approach, reinforced with IoT 
features, provided a practical and scalable solution for real-time battery monitoring. Each 
estimation method contributed unique strengths, and the Kalman filter-based fusion offered a 
balanced trade-off between accuracy, stability, and responsiveness.

9. CONCLUSION
9.1 OBTAINED RESULTS
This project culminated in the successful development of a comprehensive embedded system 
designed for real-time estimation of a battery’s State of Charge (SoC). The system integrates 
and compares three distinct estimation techniques: voltage-based, Coulomb counting, and 
Kalman filter methods. The voltage-based approach offered a fast response but was limited 
by its reliance on open-circuit conditions. Coulomb counting enabled real-time tracking of 
charge and discharge cycles but was prone to drift over time. The Kalman filter method, 
however, demonstrated superior performance, delivering high accuracy and stability even 
under dynamic load conditions.
To enhance usability and data accessibility, the estimated SoC was displayed on both a local 
LCD screen and a cloud-connected IoT dashboard, allowing for real-time monitoring. The 
system underwent rigorous testing using a real battery subjected to various charge and 
discharge cycles, and it consistently achieved an estimation accuracy within ±2–3%. These 
results affirm the practicality and effectiveness of the developed solution for real-world 
applications in battery management systems.
9.2 FUTURE IMPROVEMENT / WORK
While the current system demonstrates strong performance, several areas have been identified 
for future enhancement to improve accuracy, scalability, and user experience. One key area 
is temperature compensation, which involves integrating thermal sensors to correct SoC 
estimates affected by temperature variations—an important factor in real-world scenarios. 
Another improvement involves the implementation of adaptive Kalman filtering, where 
machine learning techniques or dynamic filter tuning can be used to enhance prediction 
accuracy under varying operating conditions.
Additionally, the current reliance on the Blynk platform for IoT monitoring can be replaced 
with a custom mobile application for Android or iOS, offering better control, personalization, 
and scalability. Expanding the system to support multi-cell SoC estimation will enable 
monitoring of entire battery packs, which is critical for electric vehicles (EVs) and solar 
energy storage systems.
29
Moreover, the integration of cloud logging and analytics, using platforms like Firebase or 
AWS, can facilitate long-term data storage and trend analysis, allowing users to track 
performance over the battery’s lifecycle. Another valuable extension is the inclusion of State 
of Health (SoH) monitoring, which would estimate battery aging and degradation, further 
enriching battery management capabilities. Lastly, the system can be integrated with solar 
photovoltaic (PV) systems, enabling intelligent energy management based on real-time SoC 
data to optimize charging efficiency.
